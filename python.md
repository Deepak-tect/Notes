# Internal working of Python:

## 1. Writing Code
Python Script: You write your Python code in a file with a .py extension, such as example.py.
## 2. Python Interpreter
1. Interpreter: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it runs code line by line using an interpreter. The interpreter is the program that reads and executes your Python code.
2. Types of Interpreters: The most common Python interpreter is CPython, but there are others like Jython (for Java), IronPython (for .NET), and PyPy (a faster alternative to CPython).
## 3. Compilation to Bytecode
1. Bytecode: When you run a Python script, the interpreter first compiles your code into a form of intermediate code called bytecode. This bytecode is a low-level set of instructions that is platform-independent.
2. .pyc Files: These bytecode instructions are stored in .pyc files (found in the __pycache__ directory) to speed up execution for subsequent runs.
## 4. Execution by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
PVM: The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is the component of the Python interpreter that executes the compiled bytecode. It reads and performs the bytecode instructions.
## 5. Memory Management
1. Memory Allocation: Python manages memory automatically using an in-built garbage collector. It allocates memory to store objects (like integers, strings, etc.) and frees it when they are no longer needed.
2. Garbage Collection: Python uses a garbage collector to track objects that are no longer in use and frees up their memory, preventing memory leaks.
## 6. Standard Library and Modules
1. Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, like file I/O, system calls, and even web development.
2. Importing Modules: You can import these modules into your script using the import statement to reuse code.
## 7. Error Handling
Exceptions: If something goes wrong during the execution of your code (like a file not being found), Python raises an exception. You can handle these exceptions using try and except blocks to make your code more robust.
