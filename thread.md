# Lifecycle of a thread

The lifecycle of a thread in Java represents its various states from creation until termination. Here's an overview of the typical lifecycle stages:

### 1. New:

- The thread is in this state when it has been created but has not yet started.
- You create a new thread instance using the Thread class constructor or by implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread constructor.

### 2. Runnable:

- Once the thread's start() method is called, the thread enters the runnable state.
- In this state, the thread is eligible to run, but the actual execution depends on the thread scheduler.

### 3. Running:

- The thread scheduler selects a runnable thread and the thread enters the running state.
- In this state, the thread's run() method is executed.

### 4. Blocked/Waiting:

- A thread can transition to the blocked or waiting state due to various reasons such as waiting for I/O operations, synchronization locks, or explicit calls to Object.wait() or Thread.sleep().
- In the blocked or waiting state, the thread is temporarily inactive and does not consume CPU time.

### 5. Timed Waiting:

- This state is similar to the blocked or waiting state, but with a specified timeout.
- Threads can enter this state by calling methods like Thread.sleep() with a specified duration, or Object.wait() with a timeout.

### 6. Terminated/Dead:

- A thread can reach this state when its run() method completes normally or when an uncaught exception terminates its execution.
- Once terminated, the thread cannot be restarted.

# Thread creation:

In Java, there are two primary ways to create threads:

### 1. Extending the Thread class:

- You can create a new class that extends the Thread class and overrides its run() method to define the behavior of the thread.
- Then, you can create an instance of this class and call its start() method to begin execution.

```java
// Define a class that extends Thread
class MyThread extends Thread {
    // Override the run() method to define the thread's behavior
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread is running: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of MyThread
        MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
        // Start the thread
        myThread.start();
    }
}
```

### 2. Implementing the Runnable interface:

- You can create a class that implements the Runnable interface and provides the thread's logic within the run() method.
- Then, you can create a Thread object, passing an instance of your Runnable implementation to its constructor, and call the start() method on the Thread object.

```java
// Define a class that implements Runnable
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    // Implement the run() method to define the thread's behavior
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Runnable is running: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of MyRunnable
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        // Create a Thread object, passing the MyRunnable instance to its constructor
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        // Start the thread
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

## Which one to use

The choice between extending the Thread class and implementing the Runnable interface depends on your specific requirements and design preferences. However, in general, implementing the Runnable interface is often considered a better practice for the following reasons:

### 1. Better Design Flexibility:

Implementing Runnable separates the task (the run() method) from the threading mechanism. This promotes a cleaner separation of concerns and better modularization in your code.
Extending Thread ties your code directly to the threading mechanism, which may limit flexibility and make it harder to reuse or extend your code.

### 2. Inheritance:

Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, so if you extend the Thread class, you lose the ability to inherit from any other class. On the other hand, implementing Runnable allows you to extend other classes as needed.

### 3. Resource Consumption:

Implementing Runnable consumes fewer system resources because you're not creating a new Thread object for each task. Instead, you're sharing a single Thread object among multiple tasks by passing the Runnable instances to it.

### 4. Encapsulation:

Using Runnable encourages better encapsulation. You can pass the same Runnable instance to multiple threads or thread pools, allowing for better control and management of your concurrent tasks.

### 5. Concurrency Utilities:

Java's concurrency utilities, such as ExecutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor, work with Runnable instances rather than Thread instances. Using Runnable facilitates integration with these utilities, making it easier to manage and control concurrency in your applications.
In summary, while both approaches work, implementing the Runnable interface is generally preferred due to its better design flexibility, inheritance benefits, lower resource consumption, better encapsulation, and compatibility with Java's concurrency utilities.

# Multiple task with multiple thread:

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    private int taskId;

    public MyTask(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is executing in thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        // Simulate some task execution
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Sleep for 2 seconds
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " has completed.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create tasks
        Runnable task1 = new MyTask(1);
        Runnable task2 = new MyTask(2);
        Runnable task3 = new MyTask(3);

        // Create threads for each task
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(task3);

        // Start threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();
    }
}
```

# Thread class

```java
public class Thread implements Runnable {
    public Thread(); // Constructs a new thread object
    public Thread(Runnable target); // Constructs a new thread with the specified target object
    public Thread(Runnable target, String name); // Constructs a new thread with the specified target object and name
    public Thread(String name); // Constructs a new thread with the specified name
    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target); // Constructs a new thread with the specified thread group and target object
    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name); // Constructs a new thread with the specified thread group, target object, and name
    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name, long stackSize); // Constructs a new thread with the specified thread group, target object, name, and stack size
    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, String name); // Constructs a new thread with the specified thread group and name

    public void start(); // Starts the thread, causing its run method to be called
    public void run(); // Entry point for the thread, contains the thread's logic
    public final void setName(String name); // Sets the name of the thread
    public final String getName(); // Returns the name of the thread
    public final ThreadGroup getThreadGroup(); // Returns the thread group to which this thread belongs
    public static int activeCount(); // Returns the number of active threads in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups
    public static int enumerate(Thread[] tarray); // Copies into the specified array every active thread in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups
    public int countStackFrames(); // Deprecated method for getting the number of stack frames in this thread
    public final long getId(); // Returns the unique ID of this thread
    public static Thread currentThread(); // Returns a reference to the currently executing thread
    public final boolean isAlive(); // Checks if the thread is alive (has been started and not stopped)
    public final void join() throws InterruptedException; // Waits for this thread to die
    public final void join(long millis) throws InterruptedException; // Waits at most millis milliseconds for this thread to die
    public final void join(long millis, int nanos) throws InterruptedException; // Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nanos nanoseconds for this thread to die
    public void interrupt(); // Interrupts this thread
    public static boolean interrupted(); // Tests whether the current thread has been interrupted
    public boolean isInterrupted(); // Tests whether this thread has been interrupted
    public final void checkAccess(); // Determines if the currently running thread has permission to modify this thread
    public static void yield(); // Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute
    public static void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException; // Causes the currently executing thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds

    public final void stop(Throwable obj); // Deprecated method for stopping this thread with an error
    public void destroy(); // Deprecated method for destroying this thread
    public State getState(); // Returns the state of this thread
    public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace(); // Returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack dump of this thread
    public static Map<Thread, StackTraceElement[]> getAllStackTraces(); // Returns a map of stack traces for all live threads
    public static boolean holdsLock(Object obj); // Returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object
    public void setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler eh); // Sets the handler for uncaught exceptions thrown from this thread
    public UncaughtExceptionHandler getUncaughtExceptionHandler(); // Returns the handler for uncaught exceptions thrown from this thread

    public static interface UncaughtExceptionHandler { // Interface for handling uncaught exceptions
        public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e); // Method called when an uncaught exception occurs in a thread
    }
}
```

# Daemon thread

In Java, a daemon thread is a special type of thread that runs in the background and doesn't prevent the JVM from exiting when all non-daemon threads have completed. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to create and use a daemon thread:

```java
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new thread and mark it as daemon
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread is running...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true); // Mark the thread as daemon
        daemonThread.start(); // Start the daemon thread

        // Main thread sleeps for a while to observe daemon thread's execution
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000); // Sleep for 5 seconds
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread exiting...");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Main thread exiting...
```

In this example:

- We create a new thread using a lambda expression that prints a message every second.
- We mark this thread as a daemon thread using the setDaemon(true) method. By default, threads are non-daemon.
- We start the daemon thread using the start() method.
- The main thread then sleeps for 5 seconds to observe the daemon thread's execution.
- After 5 seconds, the main thread prints a message and exits.

**Since the daemon thread is marked as daemon, the JVM can exit even if the daemon thread is still running. As the main thread exits, the JVM terminates all remaining daemon threads, including our daemon thread in this case.
Thus, even though the daemon thread may continue running for a few iterations after the main thread exits, it is abruptly stopped by the JVM.**

**The main thread itself cannot be marked as a daemon thread within the same main() method since the main thread is already running when the program starts.**

# Priority

In Java, you can set the priority of a thread using the setPriority() method. Thread priority is an integer value ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest. The default priority for threads is 5.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to create threads with different priorities:

```java
public class PriorityThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create threads with different priorities
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 2");
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 3");

        // Set priorities for threads
        thread1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // Lowest priority
        thread2.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // Normal priority (default)
        thread3.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Highest priority

        // Start threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();
    }

    static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We define a MyRunnable class that implements the Runnable interface. This class represents the task that will be executed by the threads.
- In the main() method, we create three threads (thread1, thread2, and thread3) with different priorities using the setPriority() method.
- thread1 is set to the minimum priority (Thread.MIN_PRIORITY), thread2 is set to the default priority (Thread.NORM_PRIORITY), and thread3 is set to the maximum priority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY).
- We start all three threads, and they execute the same task, printing their names and some numbers to the console.

Keep in mind that thread priorities are platform-dependent, and some operating systems may not support thread priorities(Windows). Additionally, relying heavily on thread priorities for application correctness can lead to non-portable and non-deterministic behavior, so it's often recommended to design your application to be thread-safe and efficient without relying heavily on thread priorities.

# yield()

The yield() method in the Thread class is a static method that suggests to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU. It's a way for the currently executing thread to voluntarily give up its current execution and allow other threads of the same priority to run.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the yield() method:

```java
public class YieldExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create two threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 2");

        // Start both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
                // Check if i is odd
                if (i % 2 != 0) {
                    // If i is odd, yield the CPU
                    Thread.yield();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`The output of the provided code may vary between different runs and across different systems due to the non-deterministic nature of thread scheduling.`

In this example:

- We create a simple Java program with two threads (thread1 and thread2) that execute the same run() method implemented by the MyRunnable class.

- Inside the run() method, each thread prints its name along with the current value of i.

- The if (i % 2 != 0) condition checks if the value of i is odd. If i is odd, the thread calls Thread.yield() to suggest to the thread scheduler that it is willing to yield the CPU.

When you run this program, you'll observe that both threads start running concurrently. However, when i is odd, the thread executing the run() method will yield the CPU, allowing the other thread to run. This demonstrates how the yield() method can be used to give other threads a chance to run, especially when the current thread's execution is not essential at the moment.

# join():

The join() method in Java is used to ensure that a thread completes its execution before the current thread proceeds further. When you call join() on a thread, the current thread will pause and wait for the specified thread to finish its execution.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the join() method:

```java
public class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 1");

        // Start thread1
        thread1.start();

        try {
            // Wait for thread1 to complete
            thread1.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Thread 1 has completed. Main thread continues...");
    }

    static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate delay
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Output:

```
Thread 1: 0
Thread 1: 1
Thread 1: 2
Thread 1: 3
Thread 1: 4
Thread 1 has completed. Main thread continues...
```

- The main thread calls join() on Thread 1, causing it to wait until Thread 1 completes its execution.

This is because there is only one thread (thread1) running, and the main thread waits for it to complete using join(). Since there is no other thread to interact with or contend for CPU time, the execution order becomes deterministic.

# interrupt()

The interrupt() method in Java is used to interrupt a thread, typically to request it to stop its execution. When you call interrupt() on a thread, it sets the interrupt status of the thread to true. This interruption can be used as a signal for the thread to stop what it's doing and either terminate gracefully or perform cleanup tasks.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the interrupt() method:

```java
public class InterruptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Start the thread

        // Interrupt the thread after 3 seconds
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        thread.interrupt(); // Interrupt the thread
    }

    static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
                System.out.println("Thread is running...");
                // Simulate some work
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    // Handle InterruptedException
                    System.out.println("Thread has been interrupted.");
                    // Optionally, perform cleanup tasks and exit the loop
                    break;
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Thread has stopped.");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Thread is running...
Thread is running...
Thread is running...
Thread has been interrupted.
Thread has stopped.

```

In this example:

- We create a thread (thread) with a MyRunnable instance and start it.
- After 3 seconds, we interrupt the thread using thread.interrupt().

Inside the run() method of MyRunnable:

- The thread enters a loop and continues running until it's interrupted (!Thread.interrupted()).
- While running, the thread prints "Thread is running..." every second to indicate its execution.
- If the thread is interrupted (e.g., by calling thread.interrupt()), it exits the loop and prints "Thread has been interrupted.".
- Finally, it prints "Thread has stopped." to indicate that it has completed its execution.

When thread.interrupt() is called, it interrupts the thread's execution, causing it to exit the loop and terminate. The interruption serves as a signal for the thread to stop its ongoing tasks and perform any necessary cleanup before exiting.

# synchronized method:

In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to control access to critical sections of code by allowing only one thread at a time to execute that code block or method. This is crucial in multi-threaded environments to prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of synchronized methods:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Synchronized method to withdraw money
    public synchronized void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            // Simulate withdrawal process
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate processing time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdraws " + amount + ". Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " tries to withdraw " + amount + ", but insufficient funds.");
        }
    }

    // Method to retrieve the current balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000); // Initial balance: $1000

        // Creating multiple threads to withdraw money
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            account.withdraw(500);
        }, "Thread 1");

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            account.withdraw(800);
        }, "Thread 2");

        // Start both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We have a BankAccount class representing a bank account with a balance.

- The withdraw() method is synchronized to ensure that only one thread can withdraw money from the account at a time. This prevents issues like overdrawing or accessing inconsistent data.
- Each thread attempts to withdraw money from the same bank account concurrently.
- The main() method creates two threads (thread1 and thread2), each attempting to withdraw different amounts of money.
- We start both threads, and each thread prints its activity, including the remaining balance after withdrawal.

With synchronized methods, the withdrawal operations will be executed one after the other, ensuring that the balance remains accurate and that withdrawals do not exceed the available funds.

# synchronized block

In Java, the synchronized keyword can also be applied to code blocks to achieve synchronization on a specific object. This allows finer control over which parts of the code need synchronization.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of synchronized blocks:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Object used for synchronization

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        synchronized (lock) { // Synchronized block
            if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
                // Simulate withdrawal process
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate processing time
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                balance -= amount;
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdraws " + amount + ". Remaining balance: " + balance);
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " tries to withdraw " + amount + ", but insufficient funds.");
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to retrieve the current balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000); // Initial balance: $1000

        // Creating multiple threads to withdraw money
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            account.withdraw(500);
        }, "Thread 1");

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            account.withdraw(800);
        }, "Thread 2");

        // Start both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We use a BankAccount class representing a bank account with a balance.
- The withdraw() method is synchronized using a synchronized block on a specific object (lock) instead of synchronizing the entire method.
- This allows finer-grained control over synchronization and can improve performance.
  Each thread attempts to withdraw money from the same bank account concurrently.
- The main() method creates two threads (thread1 and thread2), each attempting to withdraw different amounts of money.
- We start both threads, and each thread prints its activity, including the remaining balance after withdrawal.

With synchronized blocks, the withdrawal operations will be executed one after the other, ensuring that the balance remains accurate and that withdrawals do not exceed the available funds.

# Static synchronization

Static synchronization in Java is achieved by applying the synchronized keyword to static methods or code blocks. When synchronized on a static method or block, the lock acquired is on the class object, ensuring that only one thread can execute the synchronized block or method across all instances of the class.

Here's a simple example demonstrating static synchronization with a static method:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private static double balance = 1000; // Shared balance across all accounts

    // Static synchronized method to withdraw money
    public static synchronized void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            // Simulate withdrawal process
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate processing time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdraws " + amount + ". Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " tries to withdraw " + amount + ", but insufficient funds.");
        }
    }

    public static double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating multiple threads to withdraw money from the shared account
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            BankAccount.withdraw(500);
        }, "Thread 1");

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            BankAccount.withdraw(800);
        }, "Thread 2");

        // Start both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We have a BankAccount class with a shared static balance across all accounts.
- The withdraw() method is declared as static synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can withdraw money from the shared account at a time, even though multiple instances of BankAccount do not exist.
- Each thread attempts to withdraw money from the shared account using the static withdraw() method.
- The main() method creates two threads (thread1 and thread2), each attempting to withdraw different amounts of money from the shared account.
- We start both threads, and each thread prints its activity, including the remaining balance after withdrawal.

With static synchronization, only one thread can execute the withdraw() method at a time, ensuring that withdrawals are performed correctly and that the balance remains accurate.

# Multithreading InterThread Communication | wait(), notify() and notifyAll() Method:

Inter-thread communication in Java is achieved using three methods from the Object class: 
wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(). These methods are used to coordinate the execution of threads, allowing them to wait for a specific condition to be satisfied before proceeding. Here's an explanation of each method along with a simple example:

1. wait(): Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method for this object, or until a specified amount of time has elapsed.

2. notify(): Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If multiple threads are waiting, then the thread to be awakened is chosen arbitrarily.

3. notifyAll(): Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. The highest priority thread will run first.

Exmaple:

## Producer-Consumer Problem:
In the Producer-Consumer problem, there are two types of threads: producers and consumers. Producers produce data (items) and put them into a shared buffer, while consumers consume these items from the buffer. The challenge is to ensure that producers don't produce items if the buffer is full, and consumers don't consume items if the buffer is empty.

### Implementation with Synchronization:

Let's implement a simplified version of the Producer-Consumer problem using Java, and then discuss why synchronization is needed:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class ProducerConsumer {
    private LinkedList<Integer> buffer = new LinkedList<>();
    private int capacity = 5;

    public void produce() throws InterruptedException {
        int item = 0;
        while (true) {
            synchronized (this) {
                while (buffer.size() == capacity) {
                    wait(); // Wait if buffer is full
                }
                System.out.println("Producer produced item: " + item);
                buffer.add(item++);
                notify(); // Notify consumer that an item is produced
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    }

    public void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (true) {
            synchronized (this) {
                while (buffer.isEmpty()) {
                    wait(); // Wait if buffer is empty
                }
                int item = buffer.remove();
                System.out.println("Consumer consumed item: " + item);
                notify(); // Notify producer that an item is consumed
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final ProducerConsumer pc = new ProducerConsumer();

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                pc.produce();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                pc.consume();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```
1. Synchronization Using synchronized Block:

    We use synchronized blocks to ensure that only one thread (producer or consumer) can access the shared buffer at a time.
    This prevents multiple threads from concurrently modifying the buffer, which could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies.
    
2. Buffer Full and Empty Conditions:

Producers check if the buffer is full (buffer.size() == capacity) before producing new items. If the buffer is full, the producer waits (wait()) until the consumer consumes some items and notifies (notify()) the producer.
Consumers check if the buffer is empty (buffer.isEmpty()) before consuming items. If the buffer is empty, the consumer waits (wait()) until the producer produces some items and notifies (notify()) the consumer.
wait() and notify() Methods:

These methods are used for inter-thread communication to wait for a condition to be satisfied (wait()) and to notify other threads when a condition is met (notify()).
Both methods must be called within synchronized blocks to ensure proper synchronization and to avoid IllegalMonitorStateException.
By using synchronization with synchronized blocks and inter-thread communication with wait() and notify() methods, we ensure that producers and consumers operate safely and efficiently without interfering with each other in the Producer-Consumer problem.
